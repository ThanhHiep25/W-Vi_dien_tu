# V√≠ ƒêi·ªán T·ª≠ Sinh L·ªùi (Profitable E-Wallet)

This is a comprehensive, feature-rich simulated e-wallet application designed to showcase a modern, interactive, and intelligent financial management experience. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it integrates the Google Gemini API to provide smart features.

The application is a client-side simulation, with all user data, transactions, and settings persisted in the browser's `localStorage`. Features like biometric authentication, OTP, and camera scanning are simulated to demonstrate a complete user flow without requiring backend infrastructure or native device access.
